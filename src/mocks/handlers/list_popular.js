I'm a 28 year old preschool teacher turned YouTuber and entertainer.  I make \"lifestyle focused\" videos but honestly they're more sarcastic than anything. On my channel you can find me fighting with a food processor, making fun of people on the red carpet, or giving genuinely good advice (if I do say so myself). So join the #KelseySquad to be a part of the #KelseyFam and don't forget to be a proud #Kelsinator just kidding just watch my videos.\r\n\r\nMet Gala 2022 Fashion Review \r\nhttps://youtu.be/GxBH93e-FwM\r\n\r\nKelsey Kreppel\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/KelseyKreppel2",

I'm a 28 year old preschool teacher turned YouTuber and entertainer.  I make \"lifestyle focused\" videos but honestly they're more sarcastic than anything. On my channel you can find me fighting with a food processor, making fun of people on the red carpet, or giving genuinely good advice (if I do say so myself). So join the #KelseySquad to be a part of the #KelseyFam and don't forget to be a proud #Kelsinator just kidding just watch my videos.\r\n\r\nMet Gala 2022 Fashion Review \r\nhttps://youtu.be/GxBH93e-FwM\r\n\r\nKelsey Kreppel\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/KelseyKreppel2"
